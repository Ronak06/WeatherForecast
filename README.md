This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Weather Forecast
This application is a weather forecaster which leverages the Dark Sky API to provide the latest weather for a given city or user location. Additionally, users are able to get the weather for their exact location (by clicking the GPS button) or see weather in a random location by clicking the I'm Feeling Lucky button. Both of the following features leverage OpenCage Geocoder to translate longitude and latitude into a city name and vice versa.

# To run application
1. Clone application using git clone cli. 
2. Create an account on https://openweathermap.org/ and copy your API key.
3. Create a '.env' file and store the API key in a variable called 'REACT_APP_OWM_API_KEY'.
4. Run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies. 
5. Run 'npm start' in the application directory. 
6. Enjoy!
